        art director for the
        magazine
        Scandinavian
        Retro (Egmont). I have freelanced at magazines and advertising agencies as art director/graphic designer,
        photographer and web editor for the last 15 years. I have worked at Bonnier, Forma Publishing as well
        as Egmont. In 2012 I won oneshot of the year at the 2012 Swedish Magazine Awards.</p>

      <p class="presentation">Currently, I'm completing the Technigo Frontend Bootcamp - adding React, React
        Native,
        Javascript, CSS and web design to my palette. And of course I'm really eager to put my new skills to work. I'm a
        team player, I'm prestigeless, and always going for the best solution of a problem. <form action=""></form>

            I built a multi-page React application that shows the most popular movies in the US. I started by sketching
            how many pages I wanted to display and which components to use. Then I used postman to check out the api and
            how the information was set up. I worked in React using useState, useEffects, Route, Switch and
            BrowserRouter to enable the functionality in this project. If I had more time, I would have made a nav bar
            and bring in more information from different endpoints in the api.

          <p class="project-description"><span class="project-title">WEATHER APP.</span> This project was to
            build a weather web app that shows today's weather and temperature, and a 5-day forecast using a weather
            API. I started with checking out the API and tried to figure out how it worked and what kind of information
            I could fetch from it. I made a few conditionals to change the color of a section depending on the
            temperature. I did this with classList.toggle. I also used conditionals to change the color of the headline
            depending on the weather description. I did that by changing style.color in the js-file.
            I used forEach to iterate through the forecast API to get the days and temperature for each day.
            If I had more time, I would have done a dropdown menu so I would be able to choose the weather in a few
            different citys. I would also have done it responsive, as it's made now it works best for the phone. <a

        the classic board game Cluedo. Parts of the code was already written when
        the assignment started. The task was to understand the code in javascript, add additional code, and connect this
        to the DOM. First of all I grouped the elements into arrays and made objects of them, adding keys and values.
        This was the tricky part was the functionality with Javascript. After some work I managed to understand how it
        worked and I'm particularly proud of the text that turns into black when Mrs Whites white card is picked.
        Next step was to add some styling and make it responsive.<a href="https://github.com/Jenniferot/project-cluedo"

        This project was to build a website that shows new album and single releases. We practiced React and creating
        components using data from Spotify. The album titles and artists are linked to Spotify. This was a pair
        programming project. We started off by fetching the right information from the Spotify API and then displayed
        the album covers using React. We used map to iterate over an array of albums. We wrote React props, used React
        components and mounted them.
        If we had more time we would include a playlist in a sidebar. <a

        daily menu will be published every day.
        First I made a sketch of how it would look. I used flexbox to make it responsive. If I had more time I would
        make hover on the links. Maybe change the header, put in a proper logo and make the links work. <a

        a site for a company. It should contain three parts: A hero image with text above it, a signup form and an
        accordion with a section title that would expand and collapse its description with a click.
        I started of by making a simple sketch. I decided to use a background image in css for the header. I used
        flexbox for responsivness and to make my signup form look the way I wanted. I used javascript to make the
        accordion expand and collapse.
        If I had more time I would definitely make the accordion more obvious. Put a plus and minus on the title for
        example. I would also make a responsive navbar and a fixed footer. <a

        buttons and one should use a select dropdown. When the user presses submit, they should see a summary of their
        answers. I started by making components of the different questions but finally I put the questions in one
        component and
        the summary in another. I used props in the summary section and states in the app component.
        If I had more time I would have made different pages for each question. I would have styled the radio buttons
        and the checkboxes much more, for example with bounce animations and other colors. I would also add more images.

        pair-programming and worked in pairs.You could choose between three different pizzas, how many you would like to
        order and the bot would tell you the
        total cost. There were some problems with the functions, but after debugging we solved the problems. We
        commented out some code and made sure of which parts were working using console.log.
        If we had more time we would make a ux-friendly website with imagesand more css. <a
